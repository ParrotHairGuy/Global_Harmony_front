I am a supported of the declaration of independence of the internet. So this project will be on the darkweb. Otherwise it will get shut down by affected intustries. we are one race one people we might not always have the same views on issues, but i am certain with enough people helping my vision come to life, we as a race will have a bigger chance of doing actual change. We cannot invite money driven organisations into this without them having any say in the direction of this project. This AI will be driven by Objectivity disregarding ANY mopnetary considerations or powerloss for the ones incharge of our planet today. 
I am in short calling people to a cyberspace revolution of the physical world. As long as we let politicians, corporations, etc dictate how to spend money towards ensuring biodiversity, cultural diversidy. we will as a reace not survive. we need intervention now sor all of our sakes. The amount of people in the world that want change will outnumber those in power. as Anonymous says "We are legion, expect us!"
